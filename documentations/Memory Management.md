# Memory Management

Having designed for game engine learning purposes, we focus on high performance and powerful debuggable allocators with special mechanism and functionalities.

## Memory Alignment, Counting and Debugging
+ To ensure optimal performance, we have implemented a flexible memory alignment strategy. It is designed to cater both customized and stardard memory alignment approach. 
    + For customized memory alignment, developers can specify their preferred alignment mechanism, allowing for fine-tuned control over memory allocation. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where a specific allocator implementation can align memory by a faster way.
    + On the other hand, our standard memory alignment approach is supported for all custom allocators but can be slower than the customized memory alignment when used with some allocators, such as our smart chunk allocator. For more technical details, it stores the raw allocated memory address as the memory allocation header before the aligned memory block (or before the allocation debug info with allocator name or memory counting is enabled). Despite being slower, it provides a reliable and consistent method for memory alignment that works across different scenarios.
    + Moreover, the memory alignment approach can be choosen at compiletime and won't take any branching cost.
- Besides, **NCPP** has its own functionalities and flexible approach for lock-free memory counting and memory debugging. It stores the info of allocator name, memory size, etc, before the allocated memory block if the allocator name or memory counting is enabled.

## Allocators
- **ncpp::mem::TA_allocator**: the base allocator class implementing robust memory management utilities.
- **ncpp::mem::F_default_allocator**: the default allocator that can be set be user through CMake. It's set to **ncpp::mem::TF_reference_allocator**<**ncpp::mem::F_crt_allocator**> by default.
- **ncpp::mem::F_crt_allocator**: our customized current runtime allocator that supports **NCPP**'s alignment, memory counting and memory debugging approach.
- **ncpp::mem::TF_reference_allocator**: the allocator allocates and deallocates memory through the pointer to another one.
- **Chunk based allocators**:
    + As the most powerful allocators in **NCPP**, chunk based allocators come up with high allocating performance, cache optimization and much more.
    + However, they also have some drawbacks in term of memory usage and memory lifetime due to their mechanism of memory deallocating. 
    + **ncpp::mem::F_incremental_chunk_allocator**: similar to frame allocator in most game engines
    + **ncpp::mem::TF_smart_chunk_allocator**: uses the same memory allocating approach as the **ncpp::mem::F_incremental_chunk_allocator**
